"""Shared retry-with-backoff runner for mu2e env-source shell commands.

Centralizes the transient cvmfs/spack env-flake retry that was copy-pasted in
``pipeline.py:sourced_env`` and ``autoresearch_bo_michael.py:cmd_preflight``,
and was absent entirely from the two ``getToken`` sites. A cvmfs read miss
(``==> Error: [Errno 5]``) mid-``setupmu2e-art.sh`` leaves ``muse``/``mu2e``
undefined -> the command exits nonzero (often rc=127) producing little/no
output; a re-run seconds later succeeds.

See wiki/incidents/sourced-env-stderr-swallowed.md (env-source coverage map).
