# foilsX04 — silent total failure with spurious convergence

**Type:** incident
**Status:** resolved 2026-05-29 (convergence-by-pareto-hash machinery deleted entirely; zero-row safety break in `node_decide_next`; rc=3 ambiguous now retriable in `route_after_preflight`)
**Updated:** 2026-06-01 (bug #1 root cause identified — transient cvmfs env-flake in cmd_preflight, no retry; see [[sourced-env-stderr-swallowed]])

## ROOT CAUSE OF BUG #1 IDENTIFIED (2026-06-01)
The "unknown" cause of the uniform rc=3 preflight failures is the **same
transient cvmfs/spack env-source flake** documented in
[[sourced-env-stderr-swallowed]], hitting `cmd_preflight`'s OWN env-source
(`autoresearch_bo_michael.py:1039`, separate from `pipeline.py:sourced_env`).
When the flake hits, `mu2e` never runs → empty output → nonzero rc →
rc-map reads it as **rc=3 ambiguous**. The preflight log is just the 16-byte
template. X03 passed because it ran outside a bad cvmfs window; X04 (and
foilsY02 round 0 on 2026-06-01) ran inside one. Reproduced + fixed via
foilsY02: a manual re-run of the "failed" geoms passes rc=0; the fix adds
retry-with-backoff gated on "mu2e never emitted a banner"
(`autoresearch_bo_michael.py:1047`). The earlier note ("needs interactive
re-run to read the surface-check stderr") is now done — there was no
surface-check stderr because surface-check never ran.

## Summary
Closed-loop parent `foilsX04` (q=10, max-rounds=10) launched 2026-05-29,
spawned 20 children across rounds 0+1, every child's graph terminated at
the **preflight node** with status `ambiguous`, and the parent reported
`converged=True` after k=2 identical pareto-hashes — producing **zero
new leaderboard rows** while looking superficially successful.

Two distinct bugs collided to produce the silent failure:

1. **Whatever made X04 picks uniformly fail preflight with rc=3** —
   currently unknown; needs interactive re-run of
   `.venv-graph/bin/python autoresearch_bo_michael.py --mode foils preflight foilsX04R00_00`
   to read the surface-check stderr. X03 picks PASSed cleanly under the
   same code; only X04 is affected.
2. **Convergence check has no "new evals this round" floor** —
   identical pareto-hashes across rounds resolve `converged=True` even
   when 100% of children failed and the leaderboard didn't grow.

## Key facts

- **Symptoms (parent log `graph_data/closed_loop_logs/closed_foilsX04_r0.log`):**
  ```
  round 0: launched 10 children, barrier resolved, pareto_hash=6459d20d... converged=False
  round 1: launched 10 children, barrier resolved, pareto_hash=6459d20d... converged=True
  done. final keys: [...]  ← parent exits cleanly
  ```
  No errors, no traceback, no warning in the parent log.

- **Per-child evidence (`foilsX04R00_00.log` is representative of all 20):**
  ```
  [run] {"config_name": "foilsX04R00_00", "preflight": "pending", "objective": null}
  [run] {"config_name": "foilsX04R00_00", "preflight": "ambiguous", "objective": null}
  [run] done. final keys: [...]
  ```
  The graph terminates immediately after preflight returns "ambiguous";
  no submit, no harvest, no scan_logs, no evaluate.

- **Grid-work-dir forensics** (`autoresearch_grid/foilsX04R00_00/`):
  - `geom/autoresearch_foilsX04R00_00_geom.txt` — present (proposal
    rendered)
  - `state/` — empty (no `*_cluster.txt`, no `*_outputs.txt`)
  - No grid jobs were ever submitted.

- **Leaderboard delta**: 0 new rows. `wc -l leaderboard_bo_foils_v1.tsv`
  unchanged at 74 (73 data) — same as end of X03.

- **Status mapping (load-bearing, `graph/pipeline_io.py:140`):**
  `{0: "pass", 1: "fail_managed", 2: "fail_init", 3: "ambiguous"}` —
  `ambiguous` corresponds to `cmd_preflight` rc=3, which the driver
  raises on **unhandled surface-check errors** (not managed-overlap,
  not G4 init failure). Means surface-check started but blew up
  before classifying.

- **Why convergence fired falsely**: `node_refit_and_check` computes
  `pareto_hash` from the LEADERBOARD, not the round's new evals. When
  no new rows land, the hash is identical to the prior round's by
  construction. Two identical hashes → k=2 repeat → converged. Same
  failure mode as [[barrier-false-positive-round1]] but driven by
  all-children-fail rather than saver miss. **Fix shape: gate
  convergence on `len(history_after) > len(history_before)` for
  the round before counting toward k.**

- **Comparison with X03 (which worked):** X03 closed cleanly with
  50 evals across 5 rounds (leaderboard at 73 data rows). Same code
  tree, same FoilsMode class. The only environmental difference noted
  in `wiki/log.md` between X03 close and X04 launch is the
  `useTwistedBox` dispatcher work (tasks #134-136 in TaskList) —
  candidate root cause but not yet confirmed. Tasks #149 + #137
  ("Submit 3 A/B pairs tess vs twist", "Preflight both branches
  locally") are both in_progress/pending.

## 3-agent debug findings (2026-05-29)

Three parallel agents investigated; the picture diverges from the
initial single-bug hypothesis:

### Finding 1 — convergence-gate bug **CONFIRMED**
- Reproduced at `graph/closed_loop.py:424-439` in `node_refit_and_check`:
  hash is derived from GP picks (re-tellable from leaderboard), so
  identical leaderboards → identical hashes → k=2 → `converged=True`
  even when zero rows landed.
- Patch shape (~25 LOC): snapshot `len(bo.MODES[mode].load_history())`
  in `node_barrier`, skip the hash append entirely when
  `new_rows == 0`. Fail-fast or warn-and-continue is a follow-up call.
- **`tests/test_closed_loop.py` has ZERO coverage of
  `node_refit_and_check`** — that's the gap that let this ship.
  Regression test must instantiate the node with a frozen leaderboard
  + two round invocations and assert `converged=False`.

### Finding 2 — rc=3 "ambiguous" is **NOT a code regression**
- Agent reran `cmd_preflight` on three X04 configs interactively
  (`foilsX04R00_00`, `R00_05`, `R01_03`): all **PASS rc=0**. Geom
  files clean; no `useTwistedBox` / helical / TSdA leak into FoilsMode
  emission (FoilsMode emits `hasTSdA = false`).
- rc=3 emission conditions at `autoresearch_bo_michael.py:1067-1069`:
  subprocess rc≠0 AND `past_init=False` AND no `G4_GEOM_FAIL_RX`
  match AND no managed_hits AND no timeout. Anything that kills
  `mu2e -n 1` early and silently (OOM, host load, transient
  filesystem) lands here.
- **Working hypothesis**: 10 concurrent local `mu2e` preflights from
  one closed-loop round competed for cores/RAM on the parent host;
  some got OOM-killed before G4 init produced a regex-matchable
  signature. Reproducer: launch 10 simultaneous preflights from one
  shell and watch resident memory.
- Proposed mitigation at `graph/nodes.py:68`: treat `ambiguous` like
  `fail_managed` (route back to propose with attempt-cap), instead of
  terminal. Decouples the env-induced fail from the convergence path.

### Finding 3 — relaunch artifact reframes the symptom
- Parent log mtime `closed_foilsX04_r0.log` = 09:01; all 20 child
  logs `foilsX04R00_*/R01_*.log` mtime range 07:37–08:56. The
  visible parent log is a **relaunch** that reaped pre-existing
  checkpoint state and instantly reported `barrier: all resolved`.
  Same family as [[barrier-false-positive-round1]] (saver returns
  stale state). NOT a fresh run from scratch.
- `Code_helical_base.tar.bz2` mtime 2026-05-26 — predates X03 by
  three days. The `useTwistedBox` dispatcher work (TaskList #134-136)
  was completed in source but **never built/repackaged/shipped to
  grid**. Preflight doesn't load the helical lib anyway. The
  "X04 raced useTwistedBox" hypothesis in the original write-up is
  **REJECTED**.

## Patch design (post agentic review 2026-05-29)

Load-bearing facts for whoever applies these:

- **Infinite-loop risk of convergence-gate patch = NONE.**
  `route_after_decide` at `graph/closed_loop.py:454` hard-exits when
  `round_idx >= max_rounds`. Even if every round produces zero rows
  under the patched logic, the loop terminates at `--max-rounds` with
  `converged=False`. No new bound needed.
- **Best snapshot site is `node_predict_picks`** (not `node_barrier`).
  Barrier already owns sqlite+saver+polling — don't grow it. Add one
  RoundState key `history_len_before: int` set in predict_picks,
  compared in `node_refit_and_check`. (Doing it in barrier is
  acceptable but couples two concerns.)
- **`MAX_PROPOSE_RETRIES = 3`** at `graph/config.py:40` already
  bounds the blast radius of the rc=3-retriable change. Counter
  incremented in `node_propose:52`, reset to `{}` in
  `node_decide_next:188`. Per-iteration cap → worst case 3 propose
  attempts per BO iter. No separate `MAX_AMBIGUOUS_RETRIES` needed.
- **rc=3 currently routes terminal** (`graph/nodes.py:200-208`): only
  `pass` and `fail_managed` are non-terminal; `ambiguous`,
  `fail_init`, `pending` all fall to END. Docstring at
  `node_render_preflight:61` explicitly says "init failure or
  ambiguous → terminal error" — that comment also needs updating.
- **rc=3 stderr is captured but truncated to one line.**
  `cmd_preflight` already dumps last 40 lines of `mu2e` stderr to
  disk (`autoresearch_bo_michael.py:1068`); `nodes.py:69` currently
  only pipes `.splitlines()[-1]` into state errors. Patch 2 must
  also widen this — without it, repeated retries accumulate
  identical opaque "preflight[ambiguous] foo: ..." lines.
- **Stochastic retry is safe**: BO sampling means each propose
  retry draws a *different* `x`, so a true geom bug in one config
  doesn't infinite-loop on the same config.
- **Only foilsX04 has rc=3** in `wiki/incidents/` — grep
  `incidents/` for `ambiguous` / `rc=3` returns this file only
  (plus log.md backrefs). No prior incident would have been masked
  by retrying rc=3.

## Resolution applied 2026-05-29

Both findings addressed in `graph/closed_loop.py` + `graph/nodes.py`
(see [[closed-loop-runner]] "Convergence" section for design rationale):

1. **Convergence-by-pareto-hash deleted** rather than gated. 15-run
   production audit showed 0 true saves; mechanism wasn't earning
   its keep. `_pareto_hash`, `node_refit_and_check`, `pareto_hashes`/
   `converged`/`convergence_k` state keys, and the `--convergence-k`
   CLI arg all removed. Graph rewired `barrier → decide_next`
   directly. Saturation is now diagnosed post-hoc from the leaderboard
   (Pareto-front movement plots).
2. **Zero-row safety break** added in `node_decide_next`:
   `history_len_before` snapshot in `node_predict_picks`, compared
   in `node_decide_next`; if `new_rows <= 0` set `zero_rows=True`
   and `route_after_decide` ENDs. Catches "all children failed"
   round generically, not just the spurious-convergence symptom.
3. **rc=3 ambiguous now retriable** at `graph/nodes.py:route_after_preflight`
   — same MAX_PROPOSE_RETRIES=3 cap as `fail_managed`. Each propose
   retry draws a different `x` from skopt, so a true geom bug doesn't
   infinite-loop. Stderr capture widened from `splitlines()[-1]` to
   last 8 lines so repeated retries accumulate useful context.

Regression coverage in `tests/test_closed_loop.py`:
`TestDecideNext.test_zero_new_rows_sets_zero_rows_true`,
`test_negative_delta_sets_zero_rows_true`,
`TestRouteAfterDecide.test_zero_rows_ends`,
`TestBuildGraph.test_refit_and_check_removed`.

## Open questions / TODO
- **Add a concurrent-preflight-stress test** that launches N=10
  preflights from a single closed-loop round on the parent host and
  measures peak RSS. If reproduces rc=3, also gate closed_loop on a
  semaphore (`max-concurrent-preflights`) — but this is speculative
  until the OOM/load hypothesis is confirmed. The rc=3-retriable
  fix is a robustness layer, not a root-cause repair.
- **Decide leaderboard hygiene for X04**: 20 grid-work dirs with only
  `geom/` are wasted disk but harmless; safe to `rm -rf`.
