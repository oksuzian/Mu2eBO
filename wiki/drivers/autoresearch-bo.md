# autoresearch_bo.py — original 7D BO driver (removed)

**Type:** driver
**Status:** removed
**Updated:** 2026-05-21

## Summary
First-generation BO driver, optimizing only Run1A CE S/√B over a 7D foil-stack
search space. Removed from the repo on 2026-05-21 once its only consumers
(itself + the matching `autoresearch_loop.py` predecessor) were retired in
favor of [[autoresearch-bo-michael]]. The page is kept so cross-links from
[[bo-foil]] and the wiki history don't dangle.

## Key facts
- **Removed:** 2026-05-21 — see commit `git log --diff-filter=D -- autoresearch_bo.py`.
- **Why removed:** every load-bearing pattern (SETUP env, fork_config,
  run_pipeline, append_leaderboard) was reused-and-extended in
  `autoresearch_bo_michael.py`. The standalone script had no active call
  site; `leaderboard_bo.tsv` is still on disk only because slides/ analyzers
  and the data-side overlay still read it.
- **History TSV:** `leaderboard_bo.tsv` (kept, see [[leaderboards]])
