# pipeline.py — parametric grid runner

**Type:** driver
**Status:** active
**Updated:** 2026-05-19 (idempotent submit + list-outputs with `--force` escape)

## Summary
One canonical pipeline.py at the repo root. Pass `--config CFG`; per-config
paths (work tree, geom file, DSCONF, /pnfs staging dir, stage `desc` strings)
are derived from CFG. Invoked once per BO iteration after `propose` to submit
the multi-stage workflow to the grid and harvest results into `summary.json`.

Replaced the per-config rsync+sed fork pattern (see [[template-fcl-staleness]]
for the failure that motivated this).

## Key facts
- **Path:** `pipeline.py` (project root)
- **Templates:** `pipeline_templates/<stage>/template.fcl` with the geom
  basename slot marked `__GEOM_FILE__`. `submit_stage` substitutes
  `autoresearch_<cfg>_geom.txt` and writes the materialized FCL to
  `<work_root>/<cfg>/state/<stage>_template_materialized.fcl` before handing
  it to mu2ejobdef.
- **MuBeamCat input lists:** shared across all configs at
  `pipeline_templates/{mubeam,run1b_mubeam}/MuBeamCat.txt` (referenced by
  absolute path in the auxinput; no per-config copy).
- **Per-config work tree** (auto-created on first `--config CFG` invocation):
  `/exp/mu2e/data/users/oksuzian/autoresearch_grid/<cfg>/` with `geom/`,
  `<stage>/` (cnf tarballs + Code.tar.bz2), `state/` (cluster IDs, output
  lists, materialized FCL), `harvest/` (summary.json, EdepAna outputs).
- **PNFS staging:** `/pnfs/mu2e/scratch/users/$USER/autoresearch_grid/<cfg>/staged/`
- **Subcommands:** `submit | poll | list-outputs | harvest | materialize`.
  `materialize <stage>` is a debug helper that prints the substituted template
  without submitting.
- **Idempotency (landed 2026-05-19 for Phase 2b LangGraph wiring):**
  `submit` no-ops with `"already submitted (cluster=NNN); skip submit"` if
  `<stage>_cluster.txt` already exists. `list-outputs` no-ops if
  `<stage>_outputs.txt` exists AND every basename in it still resolves under
  the `/pnfs` outstage. Either guard can be bypassed with `--force` (re-submits
  to a new cluster / re-globs /pnfs respectively); use `--force` when a stage
  needs to be reseeded with a different cluster (rare; usually the right move
  is to delete the cluster file by hand). Poll and harvest have always been
  naturally re-entrant. The guards enable the LangGraph stage nodes (see
  [[graph-runner]]) to safely re-run after a checkpoint kill or hot-reload
  without double-submitting — see graph007 incident, 2026-05-19, where three
  successive submits clobbered the cluster file before the guards landed.
- **Preemptive token renewal (`submit_stage` lines 319-326, landed 2026-05-18):**
  Before every `mu2ejobsub` invocation, runs
  `bash -c 'source $SETUPMU2E && getToken'` to refresh the bearer token
  idempotently. Addresses the "cached token went stale under concurrent
  submission" sub-flavor of [[concurrent-token-contention]]. The
  jobsub_lite cache-dir same-second collision is NOT addressed by this and
  still needs a per-user flock (TODO).
- **Stages:** `mubeam` → `concat` → `mustops_ce` (Run1A) and `run1b_mubeam`
  (Run1B), defined in module-level `STAGES` dict.
- **Geom overlay:** ships via `Code.tar`; geom-bearing stages
  (mubeam, run1b_mubeam, mustops_ce) reference the same
  `autoresearch_<cfg>_geom.txt` basename via the `__GEOM_FILE__` substitution.
- **Geom auto-staging:** `autoresearch_bo_michael.py propose <cfg>` copies the
  rendered proposal into `<work_root>/<cfg>/geom/` so `pipeline.py --config
  <cfg>` runs without manual prep.
- **Harvest output:** `summary.json` with `s_over_sqrt_b`, `calo_per_pot`,
  and a `config` field naming the CFG.
- **Calo extraction:** reuses `_extract_target_al_entries` from mmackenz's
  `Run1BAna/workflows/scripts/extract_analysis_results.py`, with
  `_MUBEAM_INPUT_EFFICIENCY_BY_FCL = 0.01278168` correction.
- **Harvest env (`sourced_env(with_muse=True)`, pipeline.py:172):** sources
  `autoresearch_muse` with `muse setup -q p094` AND prepends mmackenz's
  Run1BAna lib dir to `CET_PLUGIN_PATH` + `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Reason: EdepAna
  lives in mmackenz's personal `Run1BAna` repo
  (`github.com/michaelmackenzie/Run1BAna`, **not** in Mu2e org and **not** in
  Offline/Run1Bak). Building it locally needs `EventNtuple` + an older
  Run1BAna commit that matches v13_12_10 ABI (HEAD references `_caloCluster`
  which v13_12_10 doesn't have). Cheaper: harvest is local-only so /exp paths
  work; we just borrow the prebuilt lib at
  `/exp/mu2e/app/users/mmackenz/run1b/build/al9-prof-e29-p094/Run1BAna/lib/librun1bana_workflows_EdepAna_module.so`.
- **Worker Offline source = canonical muse tarball** (`pipeline.py:45-54`
  `MUSING` + `MUSE_BASE_TARBALL`). `write_code_tarball` extracts the prebuilt
  `Code_helical_base.tar.bz2` (produced by `muse tarball` in
  `/exp/mu2e/app/users/oksuzian/autoresearch_muse/`), drops the per-config
  geom into `Code/`, writes `Code/setup_post.sh` with `MU2E_SEARCH_PATH` +
  `FHICL_FILE_PATH` extensions, then repacks. The base tarball's `setup.sh`
  calls `muse setup $CODE_DIR -q e29 prof p094`, which puts the local libs
  ahead of CVMFS via Muse's normal link/path order.
- **Helical-plug lib (landed 2026-05-17, canonicalized later that day):**
  Patched `libmu2e_Mu2eG4.so` (containing `mu2e::makeHelicalPlug` +
  `build_helical` branch in `constructTSdA`) lives inside the base tarball at
  `Code/build/al9-prof-e29-p094/Offline/lib/`. Build artifact source is
  `/exp/mu2e/app/users/oksuzian/autoresearch_muse/` (mgit Mu2eG4 sparse
  checkout of v13_12_10 + helical-plug.patch, backed by SimJob/Run1Bak,
  `muse build -j 8 → muse tarball`). See [[muse-backing-pattern]] for the
  build recipe and [[calo-constant-across-helical]] for the motivating bug.
- **Historical: `LD_PRELOAD` retired 2026-05-17.** An earlier same-day
  iteration shipped the patched lib as `Code/lib/libmu2e_Mu2eG4.so` + an
  `export LD_PRELOAD=` line in `setup.sh`, because `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is
  beaten by the `mu2e` binary's rpath. The canonical `muse setup` path
  achieves the same override via link order without needing LD_PRELOAD; the
  hand-rolled setup.sh + `Code/lib/` were dropped.
- **Failed Musing-swap attempt 2026-05-16 (historical):** `write_code_tarball`
  was briefly modified to `pushd /exp/mu2e/app/users/mmackenz/run1b && muse
  setup && popd`. All 400 helical002 smoke-test jobs (clusters 84316127,
  27871333) returned only `.log` files because **grid workers only mount
  `/cvmfs/*`** (`/exp/mu2e/app` invisible). Replaced by the tarball-shipping
  approach above; the patched lib travels inside `Code.tar.bz2` via `--code`
  staging, so worker mounts don't matter.

## Cross-links
- Consumed by: [[autoresearch-bo-michael]] `evaluate`
- Geom rendered by: [[autoresearch-bo-michael]] `propose` (auto-stages into work tree)
- See: [[grid-job-completion-check]] for monitoring conventions
- History: [[template-fcl-staleness]] (the bug this refactor closes)

## Open questions / TODO
- Eventually delete the legacy `smoke_*/` trees under
  `/exp/mu2e/data/users/oksuzian/autoresearch_grid/` once the parametric path
  has been the only one driven for a few iterations.
